          Tagged is a clothing e-commerce platform designed to allow customers
          to buy and sell clothes and accessories from local Egyptian brands.
          The project was created as a directory to help customers discover new
          local brands and easily browse products, consolidating the many new
          and independent brands that each have their own websites into one
          place.

            The Problem
          </p>
          <p>
            With an increasing number of local brands emerging in Egypt,
            customers often find it challenging to discover and compare these
            brands, as each brand maintains its own separate website. Tagged
            addresses this by hosting multiple local brands in one platform,
            making it easier for customers to search, compare, and shop across
            various stores without the need to navigate different websites.

            Goals and Objectives
          </p>
          <p>
            The main goal was to create a user-friendly and visually appealing
            dashboard for brand owners that is intuitive and easy to use.
            Additionally, the customer-facing storefront needed to be simple and
            seamless, ensuring that the shopping and ordering process was not
            interrupted by unnecessary complexity. As the project evolved, it
            was split into two sections: a customer side for browsing items and
            managing orders, and a store dashboard for brand owners to manage
            their products and track their orders.

            Development Process
          </p>
          <p>
            The development started with designing the UX/UI, ensuring both the
            dashboard for brand owners and the storefront for customers were
            clear and easy to navigate. Initially, both sections were designed
            with two views per part/page, but this approach was soon found to be
            inefficient. The app was then split into two distinct parts: the
            customer-facing store and the brand management dashboard, which
            allowed for more focused design and functionality in each area.

            Conclusion & Learnings
          </p>
          <p>
            Building Tagged helped improve my expertise in UX design and
            multi-part system architecture. Splitting the app into a customer
            side and store owner dashboard allowed for more flexibility and
            clarity in feature implementation. Additionally, privacy
            considerations and handling multi-store operations provided valuable
            insights into building a secure and efficient e-commerce platform.
