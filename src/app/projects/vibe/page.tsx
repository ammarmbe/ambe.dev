          Vibe is a social media web application with a variety of features for
          user engagement, such as posts, likes, comments, and user mentions.
          The project began as a final assignment for CS50 and later evolved
          into a personal project for learning and practicing React and Next.js.

            The Problem
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike traditional projects, Vibe was not created to address a
            specific user problem. Instead, it served as a platform for learning
            and exploring modern web technologies. The challenge was primarily
            about improving development skills and understanding full-stack web
            development.

            Goals and Objectives
          </p>
          <p>
            The main goal of Vibe was to create a fast, user-friendly social
            media application with a great user experience, responsive design,
            and strong SEO optimization. Additionally, it served as a platform
            to master React, Next.js, and full-stack development, allowing for
            the exploration of modern web technologies through practical
            implementation.

            Development Process
          </p>
          <p>
            The project began with UX/UI design, which was crucial given that
            Vibe is a user-driven platform. Several iterations of design were
            made until a satisfying, aesthetically pleasing interface was
            achieved. After finalizing the design, the development phase
            involved incremental implementation of features, starting from core
            functionality and gradually adding new capabilities over time.

            Vibe was completed in two months, but it continues to evolve as new
            features are added. The project successfully showcases skills in
            modern web development frameworks and databases, with a strong
            emphasis on user experience.

          </p>
          <p>
            Working on Vibe allowed for hands-on experience with Next.js, React,
            and PostgreSQL, enhancing both front-end and back-end development
            skills. This was particularly valuable as it was the first project
            of its kind.
